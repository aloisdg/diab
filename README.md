# Inkfathom Proxy

![banner](banner_for_light.png)

Inkfathom Proxy is a webapp to format and display a mtg deck to create proxies. [Try it Online!](https://inkfathom.netlify.app)

## Motive

MTG is a great game. A great but expensive game. I can't afford to pay for a card I wont like after two or three games. Sometimes we have to try make our mind. Beside, proxies allow to play with spoilers!

Proxies are acceptable in most casual game, so lets go to the printer and brrrr. Since I couldn't find a proxy maker suiting my need, I made my own. I don't want to keep copy/paste image in a document editor (Libre Office, Microsoft Word, or whatever).

[mtgpress.net](http://www.mtgpress.net/) is down, but alternatives include [proxymtg](http://proxymtg.net/), [MTG Proxy Generator](https://philo-jh.github.io/MTG-Proxy-Generator/) and [https://mtgprint.cardtrader.com/](https://mtgprint.cardtrader.com/). If you are looking for a windows app, you may like [Tolarian Copyshop](https://bitbucket.org/tolarianlibrarians/mtg-tolarian-copyshop/downloads/) too. I create a comparaison table, feel free to open an issue if I missed anything:
